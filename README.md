# Introduction

This is the Blog Application part of the Techcareer / Airties Cloud SW Bootcamp Graduation projects.

Using Rest API, Spring Boot, H2 Database, Docker.

The app is running in H2 Database by default, but there is a MYSQL connection details in the application.properties.
To run it on MYSQL simply comment out the H2 database and uncomment the MYSQL connection details. 

# Docker Setup

Start the terminal in the project directory. Start the containers by "docker-compose up".


## Mappings
### POST Mappings for the Diary Application
#### createBlogUser: Creates a blog user for the database.
- http://localhost:7777/api/blogApp/users/createBlogUser

        {       
            "userName": "test"
        }
Creates a new blog user to the database. Later you can use this user to create a blog post locally. We only require username on this app because
we don't want to store any personal information about the user. Email and passwords are being stored in the Register Login App.

- http://localhost:5555/api/diaryApp/posts/createDiaryPost

        {       
            "request_blogTitle": "test",
            "request_blogContent": "test",
            "request_userName" : "test",
            "request_blogUserId" : 1
        }

This creates a post without Image. To create a new post you must provide the correct username and blogUserId. You can get these information from the getAllBlogAppUsers mapping.

- http://localhost:7777/api/blogApp/users/blogPostWithImage
   
    To create a blog post with Image, you must create it like this.
